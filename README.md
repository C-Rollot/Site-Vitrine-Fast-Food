# Fast-Food Website

This is a small website based on fast-food theme. It contains:

- A home page
- A menu page, where you can see each meal with its name, photo, price and description
- A contact page, where you can get all the information you need about the restaurant (Adress, phone number, email and social media), but also a functional Google Maps map to see precisely where the restaurant is and directly redirect you to the GPS itinerary, and a comment section where customers can leave a comment to share their feedback with the owner and other potential customers
- A "feedback" page, where you can see all the customers comments

It also contains an "Admin" section where the restaurant's owner can log in, and Add / Update / Remove any meal (CRUD), but also have access to customer's email in the comments section if they want to answer a comment.
